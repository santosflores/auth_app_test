# Product Requirements Document: Authorization Demo Application

## Introduction/Overview

The Authorization Demo Application is a Flutter-based cross-platform application designed to showcase Firebase Authentication capabilities for internal stakeholders. The application demonstrates comprehensive user authentication flows including registration, login, logout, password recovery, email verification, and social login integration. Users can manage their profile information including personal details and address components.

**Problem Statement:** Internal stakeholders need a working demonstration of Firebase Auth integration to evaluate authentication capabilities and user experience flows.

**Goal:** Create a fully functional demo application that showcases all major authentication features while providing a smooth user experience across web, Android, and iOS platforms.

## Goals

1. **Demonstrate Firebase Auth Integration:** Successfully integrate Firebase Authentication with email/password and Google social login
2. **Complete Authentication Flow:** Implement all core auth features (signup, login, logout, password recovery, email verification)
3. **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Ensure the application runs seamlessly on Android, iOS, and Web platforms
4. **User Profile Management:** Allow users to store and edit comprehensive profile information
5. **Role-Based Access:** Implement basic role management system
6. **Professional Demo Quality:** Create a polished application suitable for stakeholder presentations

## User Stories

1. **As a stakeholder**, I want to see a complete authentication flow so that I can evaluate Firebase Auth capabilities
2. **As a user**, I want to create an account with email/password so that I can access the application
3. **As a user**, I want to sign in with my Google account so that I can quickly access the application
4. **As a user**, I want to reset my password via email so that I can regain access if I forget my credentials
5. **As a user**, I want to verify my email address so that I can confirm my account ownership
6. **As a user**, I want to view and edit my profile information so that I can keep my details up to date
7. **As a user**, I want to stay logged in between sessions so that I don't need to re-authenticate frequently
8. **As a user**, I want to securely log out so that I can protect my account when using shared devices
